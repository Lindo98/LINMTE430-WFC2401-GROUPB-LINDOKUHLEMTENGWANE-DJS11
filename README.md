# PodSquad designed by Lindokuhle Mtengwane ðŸŽµðŸ’¿

## Overview

### A React-based web application to browse, search, and listen to your favorite podcasts.

In this project, I have created a podcast app where a user will be able to login, choose a podcast they would like to listen to which has different episodes. The user can also mark episodes that they like add add them to favorites, the episode will be stored to local storage so they don't lose it if they logout. The web app is user friendly and has really cool features.
